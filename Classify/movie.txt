Damn you #JohnWick for being on the same time as this playoff game, now I have to change channels. #cantnotwatch
A body count well over 200 in 2 movies from a retired assassin. I cant fathom the total in his career #JohnWick
#JohnWick is one of the greatest movies ever
Also, the club scene in the first #JohnWick is one of my favorites and incredibly invigorating
Cant undersell how well they managed to make #JohnWick a singular intimidating force without overdoing it
#JohnWick may well be a masterpiece of the action genre; something it has seldom experienced.
@BatintheSun any chance we could see #JohnWick vs #ThePunisher?
