i grew up watching the justice league animated series and i enjoyed every dceu movie so far  
so i was really excited to finally see these heroes together for the first time on the big screen  
this movie and bvs are the product of a studio with no patience  
cyborgs cgi was stuck in the beta phase  
unfortunately  the movie was a letdown  its not bad by any means  but it was not as epic as it should have been
great chemistry between the league
im excited for where this universe can go next  
nice theme
such a beautiful theme
outstanding theme
