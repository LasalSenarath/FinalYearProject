Sad and angry young man is bullied by overbearing older stepbrother and his new gang of friends
this studio gave us no backstory to wonder woman and batman when bvs arrived in theaters  so it flopped
once again we get no backstory to aquaman  cyborg  or flash  even batman hasnt had a solo movie in this dc universe
so there is still hope  i get the feeling that any solo movie will be great  
some good action scenes  amazons vs steppenwolf is one the best moments of the movie   even though the movie lacks any memorable action like the ones in man of steel  bvs or wonder woman  superman is finally done right  there are some fun scenes  the flash is great and you cant ignore wonder woman every time shes on screen  aquaman and cyborg were fine
the post credit scenes are greatcons  the plot is weak  bad guy wants to destroy the world  just like the avengers  avengers  age of ultron  man of steel  suicide squad  xmen  apocalypse  etc   
but its not great either  unfortunately justice league is just okay
you wont remember it in a year  i didnt love the movie 
you can tell how it all ends  everything is very predictable the villain is really awful
very little character development you can tell basically all the scenes added in reshootsthe jokes didnt work
