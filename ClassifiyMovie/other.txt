Bama is getting ready to drive and win the game.
Defense wins championships. For UGA to win title, their defense needs to make a statement right now and stop Bama. 23 pts or more wins game.

Right now UGA/Auburn fans have the same common enemy, Alabama. This is the only night they agree in the Chick-fil-A commercial.
Not a catch and a waste of a challenge if UGA asked for it

#ThePartyFilm\rSuch a pleasant surprise. Perfectly written so every minute counts. Simple scenery highlights the amazing acting 9/10
#Eksterminator\rThe cast was great and everyone had some depth to them. The movie felt quite unreal but not fake at any moment. 7/10
#PitchPerfect3\rAmong all the songs, jokes &amp; awkwardness there was plenty of entertainment and love. Really nice ending for the Bellas 7/10
#Jungle\rToo many elements are for their own sake with nothing added to the movie. I felt like a distant spectator to Radcliffe struggle 3/10
